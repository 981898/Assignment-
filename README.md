<h1> Java </h1>
<p1>The origin of the Java language began in 1991 when <b>Sun Microsystems</b> lead architect <b>James Gosling</b>, along with
coworkers<b> Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton,</b> designed it for use in interactive television. Because the
language was far too advanced for the digital output of cable television of the time, its implementation was
deferred and it was redesigned to be used in other platforms.</p1>
<p2>Originally called<b> Oak,</b> after the tree that stood outside of Gosling’s office, the name was changed because of a
copyright already owned by<b> Oak technologies.</b> Other names that were considered were<b> Green, DNA, Silk, Neon,
Pepper, Lyric, NetProse, WRL (WebRunner Language), WebDancer, and WebSpinner.</b> The team was looking for
something fresh and wanted to avoid so called “nerdy names” with Net or Web in them. It is highly contested who
actually suggested the name<b> Java,</b> which reflected the teams’ <b>love for coffee.</b></p2>
